# Project Title: Yandex Marketing Spending Analysis - EDA & Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis

**Overview:** This project involves an analysis of marketing spend, customer behavior, and revenue generation for Y.Afisha, a subsidiary of Yandex. Using server logs, order data, and marketing spend information from January 2017 to December 2018, the analysis helps optimize marketing investments by examining customer acquisition costs (CAC), revenue (LTV), and the return on marketing investments (ROMI). Key insights focus on identifying high-performing marketing channels and optimizing spend.

**Key Skills & Concepts:**

* Data Preprocessing: Loaded and cleaned datasets from visits, orders, and marketing spend logs, ensuring proper data types and handling missing values.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed customer behavior patterns such as session durations, repeat visits, and conversion rates.
* Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Analysis: Calculated CAC for different marketing channels and assessed the profitability of these channels.
* LTV and ROMI Calculations: Computed the lifetime value (LTV) of customers and return on marketing investment (ROMI) to evaluate the efficiency of marketing campaigns.
* Data Visualization: Created visualizations to show key trends in traffic, purchases, and marketing performance across devices and ad sources.
Key Insights:

* Traffic and Revenue Correlation: Website traffic increased from September 2017 to March 2018, driving a corresponding increase in purchases and revenue.
* Marketing Channel Performance: Campaigns 4 and 5 generated higher returns despite reduced investments, while campaign 3 was identified as inefficient, with the highest CAC and lowest ROMI.
* Payback Period: The marketing payback period was approximately 5-6 months, highlighting the timeline required for ROI to cover initial marketing spend.
* Optimization Recommendations: Allocating more resources to high-performing channels (campaigns 1, 2, and 5) and reducing investment in source 3 was recommended.

**Tools Used:**

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): Data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
Statistical Testing (SciPy): Analyzed conversion rates and the efficiency of marketing spend across different sources.
